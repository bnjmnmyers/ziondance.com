					<h3>Scheduling</h3>

				<div class="section">
					<h3>Facility</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Their preferred stage dimensions are 40 feet wide by 25 feet deep.  However, they are willing to work with the space you have available.</li>
						<li>ZDC travels with a Marley Dance floor.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>Finances</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>There is no booking fee.</li>
						<li>At some point in the program it is customary for a ZDC member to share briefly about the vision of the company. This is an appropriate time to receive a love offering.</li>
						<li>Occasionally ZDC will perform in a venue that will be ticketed.</li>
						<li>For long distance travel, ZDC will request travel expenses in addition to receiving a love offering.</li>
						<li>If you have booked a special event performance where it would not be appropriate to receive a love offering, an honorarium is appreciated.</li>
